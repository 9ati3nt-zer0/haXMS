This software and its source code is not the entire site / source in all
entirety. For example - css files, images, and javascript have been stripped. The source contained within the release are structure files of how haxme.org operates - you should have a basic understanding of PHP/HTML/CSS before using the source code of these files.

Note: In future source releases, you will find a lot more source files. About 30-40 files have unfortunately been left out of this release.
